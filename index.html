          <p>
            Hello, I'm Mustafa Ibrahim, a recent Oil and Gas graduate with a strong passion for Petroleum engineering. Proficient in <strong>Pipesim</strong>, <strong>Petrel</strong>, and <strong>Techlog</strong> software, I bring a logical problem-solving approach to technical challenges. Graduating with a <strong>3.5</strong> GPA and at the <strong>top of my class </strong>from the University of Thi-Qar, I'm driven by continuous learning and have completed courses in drilling, production, and reservoir engineering. Additionally, I am skilled in <strong>MATLAB</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Office</strong>.
            Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy hiking, photography, and volunteering for environmental causes. Furthermore, I have a keen interest in <strong>web development</strong>, which has provided me with a solid foundation in <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>. As an advocate for sustainable energy solutions, I'm eager to contribute my skills to both the upstream and downstream sectors of the industry.
            I'm currently <strong>seeking opportunities</strong> to apply my expertise and contribute to the success of Petroleum engineering projects.
            Feel free to <strong><a href="contact me.html">connect with me</a></strong> to explore potential collaborations. Let's work together to create a greener and more efficient energy future.

    <h3>Education:</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>University of Thi-Qar, Oil and Gas Department, Sep 21, 2019 - Jul 26, 2023</li>

          <li><strong>Grade</strong>: 3.5 or 87.54%, at top of my Class</li>
          <li><strong>Project Name</strong>: Theoretical Study of Water Condensation Rate in Oil and Gas Pipeline During Wet Gas Transportation</li>
          <li><b>Project Discription</b>: The provided research aims to investigate water condensation rates (WCR) in wet gas pipelines. The study employs a mathematical model developed by Zhang and colleagues, implemented using MATLAB. This model predicts water droplet condensation in a stagnant gas environment. It considers input parameters such as gas and pipe temperature, internal pipe diameter, and total pressure.
          The research findings highlight significant influences on WCR:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>A temperature difference increase from 20°C to 60°C leads to a 12-fold rise in condensation rate.</li>
              <li>Pressure elevation from 1 bar to 20 bar results in a 4.5-fold increase in condensation rate, and from 20 to 100 bar leads to a 2.2-fold increase in WCR.</li>
            </ol>
          This study contributes valuable insights into managing pipeline integrity issues related to condensation and offers a robust mathematical tool for predicting and understanding condensation behavior under various parameters.
